# Welcome to ChemoTyper

## ChemoTyper application

The ChemoTyper application is a tool that allows for searching and highlighting chemotypes (chemical substructures or subgraphs) in datasets of molecules. Typical applications are as follows.

*   Searching for structural alerts for toxicity in chemical structure files
*   Filtering of chemical structures according to chemotypes
*   Visualization and inspection of chemotypes
*   Grouping of chemicals according to chemotypes, and
*   Fingerprinting of chemical structure sets against chemotypes

The ChemoTyper application houses the [​ToxPrint](https://github.com/mn-am/toxprint) chemotypes library. The [​ToxPrint](https://github.com/mn-am/toxprint) chemotypes library is a public set of chemotypes developed by Altamira LLC for the CERES project of the U.S. FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The [​ToxPrint](https://github.com/mn-am/toxprint) chemotypes library contains three basic subsets.

*   Generic structural fragments
*   Ashby-Tennant genotoxic carcinogen rules [​(J Ashby, RW Tennant 1988)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-1218(88)90114-0)
*   Cancer TTC categories [​(R Kroes *et. al.* 2004)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2003.08.006).
